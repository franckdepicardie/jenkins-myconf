When accessing Salesforce--either via a desktop client or the API--from outside of your companyâ€™s trusted networks, you must add a security token to your password to log in. To get your new security token, log in to Salesforce. From your personal settings, enter Reset My Security Token in the Quick Find box, then select Reset My Security Token.
